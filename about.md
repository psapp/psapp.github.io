Provable software (in the mathematical sense) provides a number of significant advantages over unproven software.

There's a large body of work 'out there': things like seL4 and Microsoft's Ironclad project.

We're attempting to push the boundaries by getting these technologies out into the things that we rely on from day to day. We take a pragmatic approach: a proof of some part of a system is better than no proof at all, so it's better to have a mix of proven and unproven code than to insist on pure proven code.

So we're working on proving boring things. Web servers. Chat clients. Utilities.
